	"description": "Describes how errors from the SDK are reported.",
	"content": "For the sake of clarity, most examples in the documentation do not fully demonstrate how to handle errors, preferring instead to focus on the topic at hand. However, the Diatheke SDK does report errors, and client applications should be prepared to handle them.\nA description of how errors are handled for each language is given below.\nC++ The C++ SDK uses exceptions to report errors. Errors originating from the SDK will have the class type Diatheke::ClientError, which inherits from the std::exception class. To handle these errors, simply create a try-catch block around the SDK code. For example:\ntry { // Call SDK functions in here. The function calls may be in this  // try block, or within functions that the try block calls. } catch (const Diatheke::ClientError \u0026amp;err) { // Handle the error here. The specific error message can be  // retrieved using err.what(). } Go The Go SDK uses the built-in error type to return errors from functions (see here for general information about handling errors in Go). Most SDK functions will return an error in addition to their other return values. For example:\n// Create a new client connection client, err := diatheke.NewClient(\u0026#34;127.0.0.1:9002\u0026#34;) if err != nil { // Handle the error here. } Python The Python SDK uses built-in exceptions to report errors. They can be handled by wrapping the client code in a try \u0026hellip; except statement. For example:\ntry: # Call SDK functions in here. The SDK functions may be # called directly, or within other functions that this # block eventually calls. except BaseException as err: # Handle the error here. To have better control over how # individual errors are handled, you may use more concrete # exception types in the except statement. finally: # Do any final cleanup here. Swift In the Swift SDK Every method that can thow an error has DiathekeFailureCallback completion handler to report errors. For example:\nclient.newSession(model: model, success: { (sessionID) in // Handle success response here }) { (error) in // Handle the error here print(error.localizedDescription) } "

Note that if the server has TLS enabled, attempting to connect with an insecure client will fail.\nTo create an insecure connection, do the following when creating the client:\nClient Authentication In our recommended default setup, TLS is enabled in the gRPC setup, and when connecting to the server, clients validate the server\u0026rsquo;s SSL certificate to make sure they are talking to the right party. This is similar to how \u0026ldquo;https\u0026rdquo; connections work in web browsers.\nIn some setups, it may be desired that the server should also validate clients connecting to it and only respond to the ones it can verify. If your Diatheke server is configured to do client authentication, you will need to present the appropriate certificate and key when connecting to it.\nPlease note that in the client-authentication mode, the client will still also verify the server\u0026rsquo;s certificate, and therefore this setup uses mutually authenticated TLS. This can be done with:\nclassDiathekeConnection{\n\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;let\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#40ffff\u0026quot;\u0026gt;serverAddress\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; = \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#ed9d13\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#34;localhost\u0026amp;#34;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;let\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#40ffff\u0026quot;\u0026gt;serverPort\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; = \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#3677a9\u0026quot;\u0026gt;9002\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;let\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#40ffff\u0026quot;\u0026gt;client\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; = Client(host: serverAddress, port: serverPort, tlsCertificateFileName: \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#ed9d13\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#34;root\u0026amp;#34;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, tlsCertificateFormat: .pem)  } "

	"content": "Not to be confused with a session\u0026rsquo;s audio input stream, a plain ASR stream is used to process audio and receive a transcript from Diatheke. This functionality is particularly useful for ASR tasks that fall outside of the normal dialog flow. For example, an application that wants to allow a user to record a note while in the middle of a task could use this stream to get a transcript that can be saved.\nSending audio on an ASR stream does not affect the state of any running sessions, or cause the dialog to transition between states. It essentially forwards the ASR request to the underlying Cubic engine and forwards the transcription back to the client. The fact that the ASR stream can be used without a session, makes it particularly useful for debugging audio issues.\nCreating an ASR Stream The ASR stream requires a Cubic model (defined in the Cubic server config file) to be specified at creation. The returned stream will be a bi-direction stream that allows the client code to push audio to the server, while concurrently receiving transcripts from the server as they become available.\nThere is no limit on the number of ASR streams that may be opened at a time, but as most the most common use case involves using a single input source (e.g., microphone), it usually won\u0026rsquo;t make sense to have more than one ASR stream running at a time.\n// Create the bi-directional ASR stream stream, err := client.StreamASR(context.Background(), cubicModel) // Create the bi-directional ASR stream std::unique_ptr\u0026lt;Diatheke::ASRStream\u0026gt; stream = client.streamASR(cubicModel); # Create the bi-directional ASR streamstream = client.stream_asr(cubic_model) Create the bi-directional ASR stream letstream= client.streamASR(model: cubicModel) { (response) in// Handle ASR responseself.handleASRResponse(response) } Pushing Audio It is the client code\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to handle getting audio data, whether it is from a microphone, file, or some other source. Audio data should be formatted and encoded based on the specific ASR model being used for the stream. The audio data is then pushed to the server as demonstrated below.\nAfter all audio data has been pushed to the server, client code should be sure to call the AudioFinished() method to notify Diatheke that no more audio will be coming.\n// Get the audio data from a source. This could be a microphone, file, or // any other source. Here we assume the audio data was retrieved previously // and stored in our buffer. // Push the audio data to the stream.

It is safe to call concurrently with the corresponding result_stream.stream.pushAudio(data: data)\n// Be sure to notify Diatheke that no more audio will be coming when are// done writing data.stream.finishAudio() Receiving Transcriptions Transcripts are received over the same ASR stream used to push audio, as demonstrated below. It is safe to call both PushAudio() and Receive() concurrently (i.e., on different threads), however it is not safe to call the same method concurrently. For example, it is an error to call Receive() for the same stream simultaneously from two threads.\nThe transcript returned will include the transcript\u0026rsquo;s text and a confidence score, which is a measure of how confident the ASR engine is that the transcript matches the supplied audio. The confidence score will be between 0.0 and 1.0, with 1.0 meaning that the ASR engine is very confident that the transcript matches what was spoken.\nThe receiving end of the ASR stream will close after the sending side of the stream is closed (e.g., by calling AudioFinished()).\n\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#999;font-style:italic\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// This indicates the stream has finished, which will happen  // after the stream's AudioFinished() method is called or the // context used to create the stream closes. iferr == io.EOF { break} iferr != nil{ fmt.Printf(\u0026quot;Error: %v\\n\u0026quot;, err) return}\n\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#999;font-style:italic\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Display the transcript  fmt.Printf(\u0026quot;ASR Response:\\n\u0026quot;) fmt.Printf(\u0026quot; Transcription: %s\\n\u0026quot;, transcript.Text) fmt.Printf(\u0026quot; Confidence Score: %v\\n\\n\u0026quot;, transcript.ConfidenceScore) } "

	"content": "Not to be confused with a session\u0026rsquo;s audio output stream, a plain TTS stream is used to synthesize speech unrelated to any currently running sessions or Diatheke models. This means that, unlike audio output from a session which is sent to the client in response to user input as defined in the model, the audio output for a plain TTS stream is returned to the client immediately after the TTS request is made.\nThis functionality is provided mainly as a convenience. There may be some situations where it is useful to synthesize audio unrelated to a running session (such as debugging). For the majority of situations, Cobalt recommends embedding TTS replies in the Diatheke model itself, so that they may be returned as part of the normal dialog flow for a session.\nCreating the TTS Stream The TTS stream requires a Luna model (defined in the Luna server config file) and the text to synthesize to be specified at creation. The returned stream will receive audio data from the server until synthesis is complete and the stream is closed.\n// Create the TTS stream stream, err := client.StreamTTS(context.Background(), lunaModel, sentence) // Create the TTS stream std::unique_ptr\u0026lt;Diatheke::TTSStream\u0026gt; stream = client.streamTTS(lunaModel, sentence); # Create the TTS streamstream = client.stream_tts(luna_model, sentence) // Create the TTS streamclient.streamTTS(model: lunaModel, text: sentence) { (response) in// Handle TTS responseself.handleTTSResponse(response) } Receiving Audio The only data returned on the TTS stream will be audio data.

For example, if the model defines an intent that includes the phrase \u0026ldquo;check account balance\u0026rdquo;, a user may speak that phrase and expect Diatheke to respond. If, however, the user speaks the phrase \u0026ldquo;buy pizza\u0026rdquo;, and that intent is not in the model, Diatheke may ignore the phrase or reply with an error message, such as \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand that\u0026rdquo;.\nTo begin a new dialog, create a session by doing the following:\n// Be sure to close the session when we are done with it. deferclient.EndSession(context.Background(), sessionID) // Be sure to close the session when we are done with it. client.endSession(sessionID); # Be sure to close the session when we are done with it.client.end_session(session_id) client.newSession(model: modelID, success: { (sessionID) inself.sessionID = sessionID }) { (error) inprint(error.localizedDescription) }\n// Be sure to close the session when we are done with it.client.endSession(sessionID: sessionID) { (error) inprint(error.localizedDescription) } Creating a new session will return a session ID, which is required for all the session functions in the SDK.\nAs shown in the example, sessions should be closed when they are no longer in use. This has the side-effect of freeing resources related to the session on the server.\nIt should also be noted that simply exiting the application or closing the client will not end a session on the server. This is by design - in some situations, it may be convenient to save the sessionID and resume session interactions after creating a new client connection. For example, it might not make sense to preserve the network connection for a long running commands. The client code could save the session ID, close the client connection, execute the command, then restart the client and resume the session when the command has finished.\nThe Session Object For those who prefer a more object oriented approach to interacting with sessions, the SDK provides a convenience class that wraps the client and session ID. The session object includes all the session functions as class members.\n// Use session methods without the ID as a parameter err := session.EndSession(context.Background()); // Use session methods without the ID as a parameter session.EndSession(); # Use session methods without the ID as a parametersession.end_session() Use session methods without the ID asa parameter session.endSession { (error) inprint(error.localizedDescription) } "

The stream will be closed by the server when the session ends.\nEvent Handling The recommended way to handle events from the stream is to setup a loop that waits for the next event, then handles the event based on its type:\n\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#999;font-style:italic\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// This indicates the stream has finished, which will happen  // when the session ends or the context used to create the stream // closes. iferr == io.EOF { break}\n\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#999;font-style:italic\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Handle any other errors  iferr != nil{ fmt.Printf(\u0026quot;Error: %v\\n\u0026quot;, err) break}\n\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#999;font-style:italic\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Handle the event based on its type.  switche := event.Result.(type) { case*diathekepb.DiathekeEvent_Recognize: handleRecognizeEvent(e.Recognize)\n\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;case\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; *diathekepb.DiathekeEvent_Reply: \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#447fcf\u0026quot;\u0026gt;handleReplyEvent\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(e.Reply) \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;case\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; *diathekepb.DiathekeEvent_Command: \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#447fcf\u0026quot;\u0026gt;handleCommandEvent\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(e.Command, manager.Session) \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;default\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: fmt.\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#447fcf\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Printf\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#ed9d13\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#34;Error: received unknown event type from Diatheke\\n\u0026amp;#34;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;) }  } // It is good practice to close the event stream when we are done with it. // This will allow the server to report errors related to the stream, if // there were any. eventStream-\u0026gt;close(); \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;elif\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; event.HasField(\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#ed9d13\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#34;reply\u0026amp;#34;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;): handle_reply_event(event.reply) \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;elif\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; event.HasField(\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#ed9d13\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#34;command\u0026amp;#34;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;): handle_command_event(event.command, session) \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;else\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;print\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#ed9d13\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#34;Received unknown event type from Diatheke.\u0026amp;#34;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;)  \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#999;font-style:italic\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Check the event type\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;switch\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; result { \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;case\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; .recognize(\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;let\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#40ffff\u0026quot;\u0026gt;recognizeEvent\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;): \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;self\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.handleRecognizeEvent(recognizeEvent) \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;case\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; .reply(\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;let\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#40ffff\u0026quot;\u0026gt;replyEvent\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;): \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;self\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.handleReplyEvent(replyEvent) \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;case\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; .command(\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;let\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#40ffff\u0026quot;\u0026gt;commandEvent\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;): \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\u0026quot;\u0026gt;self\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.handleCommandEvent(commandEvent, session: session) }  } Recognize Event The Recognize event is sent when Diatheke has received user input. In the case of text-based input, the text of the event will be the same as what was typed by the user. In the case of audio-based input, the event is sent when enough audio has been processed that a transcription is available. In this case, the text of the event will be the ASR transcription. The event will also indicate whether the user input was recognized by the NLU as a valid intent or entity.\nMost often, this event will be used by clients to give some kind of visual indication to the user about whether their input was recognized or not.\nReply Event The Reply event is sent when, based on the session\u0026rsquo;s model, Diatheke has a reply for the user. This might happen when Diatheke needs additional information from the user, in which case the text of the Reply event will be a prompt. This event may also be sent to give the user information, such as after running a command. The text for all Reply events is defined in the Diatheke model.\nMost often, this event will be used by clients to give some kind of visual feedback to the user.\nCommand Event The Command event is sent when Diatheke wants the client to execute a command. This happens after the corresponding intent and entities have been recognized, and Diatheke is in a state where the command has all the required information to execute (as defined by the Diatheke model).\nFrom the client perspective, this is the most important event that will come from Diatheke because it is what prompts the client code to do useful work by executing the commands.\n\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color:#999;font-style:italic\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// After executing the command, be sure to notify Diatheke that  // we are done.

When Diatheke wants to reply to user input, this stream will receive notifications with the text of the reply, and the TTS generated audio bytes.\nCreating the Audio Reply Stream Before any audio for the session can be received, the client code should first create the audio reply stream. Similar to the event stream, this stream will be closed by the server when the session ends.\n// OR create the stream using the Session object stream, err := session.StreamAudioReplies(context.Background()) // Create the stream using the client and session ID stream = client.streamAudioReplies(sessionID);\n// OR create the stream using the Session object stream = session.streamAudioReplies(); # OR create the stream using the Session objectstream = session.stream_audio_replies() OR create the stream using the Session object letstream= session.streamAudioReplies { (reply) in// Handle audio reply} Receiving Audio A single reply from Diatheke will have multiple messages on the audio reply stream. First, it will receive a message containing the text of the reply. Then, it will receive one or more messages containing the TTS generated audio data. Lastly, it will receive an empty message that contains no data, but serves as an indicator that the reply has finished TTS generation and that no more data will be coming for the current reply. An example showing how to handle these cases is given below.\nThe TTS generated audio data will be formatted and encoded based on the specific TTS model being used for the session (as defined in the Diatheke server config file).

	"content": "The Diatheke API is defined using gRPC and protocol buffers. This section of the documentation is auto-generated from the protobuf file. It describes the data types and functions defined in the spec. The \u0026ldquo;messages\u0026rdquo; below correspond to the data structures to be used, and the \u0026ldquo;service\u0026rdquo; contains the methods that can be called.\ndiatheke.proto Service: Diatheke Service that implements the Cobalt Diatheke Dialog Management API.\n   Method Name Request Type Response Type Description     Version Empty VersionResponse Queries the Version of the Server.   Models Empty ModelsResponse Models will return a list of available versions. Model values from this list may be used in NewSession calls.   NewSession NewSessionRequest SessionID Requests a new session with the given config and returns the session ID, which is required for other rpc methods.   EndSession SessionID Empty Terminates an existing session and closes any open event streams. It is an error if the SessionEndRequest has an invalid SessionID.   SessionEventStream SessionID DiathekeEvent Requests a new event stream for the given session.   CommandFinished CommandStatus Empty Notify Diatheke when a command has completed so that it may update the dialog state. The initial command request will come as part of a DiathekeEvent. While not strictly required (depeding on the model and command), it is best practice to always call this method when a command is complete. Cases where it is required include when the command has output parameters, or when the command is followed by another action in the Diatheke model.   StreamAudioInput AudioInput Empty Begin an audio input stream for a session. The first message to the server should specify the sessionID, with binary audio data pushed for every subsequent message. As the audio is recognized, Diatheke will respond with appropriate events on the session\u0026rsquo;s event stream. While it is allowed to call this multiple times during a single session, clients should never have multiple audio input streams running concurrently for the same session (the audio may mix and result in unpredictable behavior). Previous audio streams should always be closed before starting a new one.   StreamAudioReplies SessionID AudioReply Create an audio reply stream for a session. The returned stream will receive replies (\u0026ldquo;say\u0026rdquo; entries in the Diatheke model) from the server as they occur in the conversation. For each \u0026ldquo;say\u0026rdquo; entry, the stream will first receive the text to synthesize (defined by the model), followed by one or more messages containing the synthesized audio bytes. The \u0026ldquo;say\u0026rdquo; entry will end with a message indicating that TTS for that entry is complete. NOTE: The text in the first message of an audio reply is the same that will be received in the session\u0026rsquo;s event stream.   PushText PushTextRequest Empty Push text to Diatheke as part of the conversation for a session. Diatheke will respond with an appropriate event on the session\u0026rsquo;s event stream based on whether the given text was recognized as a valid intent or not.   StreamASR ASRRequest ASRResponse Manually run streaming ASR unrelated to any session by pushing audio data to the server on the audio stream. As transcriptions become available, the server will return them on the ASRResponse stream. The transcriptions may then be used for, e.g., the PushText method. This function is provided as a convenience.   StreamTTS TTSRequest TTSResponse Manually run streaming TTS. The Audio stream will receive binary audio data as it is synthesized and will close automatically when synthesis is complete. This function is provided as a convenience.    Message: ASRRequest Request for streaming ASR unrelated to a session.\n   Field Type Label Description     model string  The model to use for ASR. This message should always be sent before any audio data is sent.   audio bytes  Audio data to process. The encoding of the data should match what was specified in the Diatheke server configuration. NOTE: If the audio data is empty, the server may interpret it as the end of the stream and stop accepting further messages.    Message: ASRResponse ASRResponse contains speech recognition results.\n   Field Type Label Description     text string  Text is the Cubic engine\u0026rsquo;s formatted transcript of pushed audio. This field will be the 1-best alternative.   confidence_score double  The confidence score is a floating point number between 0.0 - 1.0. A score of 1.0 indicates that the ASR engine is 100% confident in the transcription.    Message: AudioInput Provides input audio data for StreamAudioInput. The first message sent must contain the session ID only. All subsequent messages must contain audio data only.\n   Field Type Label Description     session_id string  Session ID returned from the NewSession call.   data bytes  Audio data to process. The encoding of the data should match what was specified in the Diatheke server configuration. NOTE: If the audio data is empty, the server may interpret it as the end of the stream and stop accepting further messages.    Message: AudioReply An AudioReply is the verbal and textual reply that Diatheke returns as part of a conversation (not to be confused with the server concepts of request and response).\n   Field Type Label Description     label string  The label defined in the Diatheke model. Identifies which \u0026ldquo;say\u0026rdquo; entry in the model this message corresponds to.   text string  The reply text as defined in the Diatheke model. This is the first message that will be received for an AudioReply. It contains the same text as the corresponding ReplyEvent in the session\u0026rsquo;s event stream.   data bytes  The audio data from TTS. There can be any number of these messages for an AudioReply after the first text message and before the final end message. The encoding of the data will match what was specified in the server configuration.   end Empty  Indicates that TTS has finished streaming audio for the reply. This is the last message that will be received for an AudioReply.    Message: CommandEvent A CommandEvent occurs when Diatheke wants the client to execute the given command.\n   Field Type Label Description     command_id string  ID of the command that should be run. i.e. \u0026ldquo;COM01\u0026rdquo; for Command #01.   parameters CommandEvent.ParametersEntry repeated A generic map of parameters (name, value). The parameters are defined in the Diatheke model. Depending on the command, these parameters should be sent back with the CommandStatus update.   command_state_id string  ID to keep track of the dialog state when the command is requested. This field is required in the CommandStatus message so that Diatheke can correctly update the dialog state when CommandFinished is called.    Message: CommandEvent.ParametersEntry    Field Type Label Description     key string     value string      Message: CommandStatus The final status of an executed command.\n   Field Type Label Description     session_id string  session_id should be the same as the status id returned from NewSessionResponse.   command_id string  ID of the command as given in the RunCommand object.   return_status CommandStatus.StatusCode     output_parameters CommandStatus.OutputParametersEntry repeated The populated output parameters from the RunCommand object. For example, the map might contain the entry \u0026ldquo;temperature\u0026rdquo;, which was populated with a value of \u0026ldquo;30\u0026rdquo; after the command finished.   error_message_text string  Set this field with an error message if an a error occured while executing the command.   command_state_id string  State ID from the original CommandEvent. This field is required for Diatheke to correctly update the dialog state when CommandFinished is called.    Message: CommandStatus.OutputParametersEntry    Field Type Label Description     key string     value string      Message: DiathekeEvent An event from Diatheke in response to either recognized audio or submitted text.\n   Field Type Label Description     command CommandEvent  Indicates Diatheke found an actionable state in the dialog, and requests the client to perform the given command.While not strictly required (depeding on the model and command), it is best practice to always call CommandFinished after receiving this event so that Diatheke can update the dialog state when the command is complete. Cases where it is required include when the command has output parameters, or when it is followed by another action in the Diatheke model.   recognize RecognizeEvent  An event indicating whether pushed text and audio was recognized by ASR and/or Diatheke.   reply ReplyEvent  The textual reply from Diatheke in the conversation (not to be confused with the server concepts of request and response). For example, this could be a question to solicit more information from the user, a status report, or any other reply defined by the Diatheke model. The text of this message is also provided in the AudioReply stream (if one is open).    Message: Empty This message is empty and has no fields.\nMessage: ModelsResponse The message sent by the server in response to a Models request. Returns an array of model names.\n   Field Type Label Description     models string repeated Array of models available for use.    Message: NewSessionRequest Request for the NewSession call.\n   Field Type Label Description     model string  For applications that have more than one model to use for ASR/NLU. ASR grammar can vary between models, as well as sets of commands. Some applications will only have one model.    Message: PushTextRequest Request to push text to Diatheke as part of a conversation.\n   Field Type Label Description     session_id string  Session ID returned from the NewSession call.   text string  User input. This could be a transcription from manually run ASR, text selected from a dropdown list, entered in a prompt, etc.    Message: RecognizeEvent A RecognizeEvent occurs if a session\u0026rsquo;s audio input has a transcription available, or if the PushText method was called. In both cases, the event will indicate whether the text was recognized as a valid intent by the Diatheke model.\n   Field Type Label Description     text string  The pushed text or transcription of audio sent to Diatheke.   valid_input bool  True if the submitted text or audio transcription was recognized by the Diatheke model as a valid intent or entity.    Message: ReplyEvent A ReplyEvent occurs when Diatheke has a reply in the conversation (not to be confused with the server concepts of request and response). These correspond to \u0026ldquo;say\u0026rdquo; entries in the Diatheke model. For example, it might be a prompt for additional information from the user, a status update, or a confirmation. ReplyEvents are not generated in response to StreamTTS calls.\n   Field Type Label Description     text string  Text of the reply event (defined by the Diatheke model).   label string  Label of the reply event (defined by the Diatheke model).    Message: SessionID Simple message that only contains the session ID.\n   Field Type Label Description     session_id string  Session ID returned from the NewSession call.    Message: TTSRequest Request to synthesize speech unrelated to a session.\n   Field Type Label Description     model string  The model to use for TTS (defined in the server config file).   text string  Text to synthesize    Message: TTSResponse Response for text-to-speech unrelated to a session.\n   Field Type Label Description     data bytes  The synthesized audio data. The data encoding will match what was specified in the server configuration.    Message: VersionResponse The message sent by the server for the Version method.\n   Field Type Label Description     server string  Server that manages all of the the other components.    Enum: CommandStatus.StatusCode CommandStatus are the resulting states of a command.\n   Name Number Description     SUCCESS 0 SUCCESS indicates that the command was successfully completed, and the dialog state may now move on to the next state.   FAILURE 1 FAILURE indicates that the command was not successfully completed, and the dialog state should be updated accordingly.

	"content": "Action When a user says something, it is converted to intents and entities. Then, the system can take any action in response. Actions can include text-to-speech output, or running a specific command.\nFor example, if someone asks to pay money off their credit card, then the system should interact with the banking backend to pay the card, while also playing a TTS response to confirm to the user what is happening.\nASR The first step in any dialogue system is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which converts the audio of someone\u0026rsquo;s utterance into text. ASR usually outputs in \u0026lsquo;spoken form\u0026rsquo;, i.e. numbers and other expressions are in words, not digits (\u0026ldquo;three hundred and twenty one\u0026rdquo; and not \u0026ldquo;321\u0026rdquo;), but automatic formatting can optionally be applied.\nDiatheke uses Cobalt\u0026rsquo;s ASR engine, Cubic, to process audio and supply transcripts.\nCommand A command is a specific type of action that executes some set of tasks in response to a recognized intent. For example, if the utterance \u0026ldquo;Play some music\u0026rdquo; was recognized as an intent, the command might handle the actual playback of an audio file.\nEntity An entity (a.k.a. a slot) appears in an utterance. It represents a value in an intent that can change between utterances or even be omitted entirely in some cases. Entities are defined in the Diatheke model.\n \u0026ldquo;Book me threeplanetickets from Londonto New York, please.\u0026rdquo;   \u0026ldquo;Play the song New York\u0026rdquo;   \u0026ldquo;Pay threepounds off my credit card.\u0026rdquo;   The first two examples have entities that are cities - the first has a single City, while the second might have a SourceCityand DestinationCity.\nThe second and fourth examples have entities that are numbers, though they are interpreted differently in the two utterances. One is a quantity, and the other is an amount of money.\nThe same words can mean different entities in different contexts. E.g. \u0026lsquo;New York\u0026rsquo; could be either a Cityor a SongName, depending on the context.\nIntent Intent is the name for a group of utterances which mean the same sort of thing and result in a particular action being taken. Intents are defined as part of the Diatheke model.\nNLU Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a field within artificial intelligence that deals with machine reading comprehesion. It attempts to discern the meaning of (sometimes incomplete) sentences. In Diatheke, these interpretations are the intent with its associated entites.\nSession A session represents all the components (ASR, TTS, NLU, etc.) necessary to carry on a conversation with Diatheke. A single session keeps track of a dialog\u0026rsquo;s current state, with all possible states being defined by a Diatheke model.\nSlot See Entity\nTTS Text To Speech (TTS) synthesizes audio that replicates human speech from written text.\nDiatheke uses Cobalt\u0026rsquo;s TTS engine, Luna, to process audio and supply transcripts.\nUtterance An utterance is something that someone says - it isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a full sentence as people don\u0026rsquo;t always speak grammatically.\n"

	"content": "Diatheke API Overview Diatheke is Cobalt\u0026rsquo;s dialog management engine. It uses a combination of speech technologies and artificial intelligence to allow users to interact with computers and mobile devices through audio and text based dialogs.\nAudio Based Dialogs Audio based dialog management uses multiple speech technologies, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Text To Speech (TTS). It starts with audio input from a client application (human speech), which Diatheke sends to the ASR engine to get a transcription. This transcription is passed on to the NLU engine, which converts the transcription into an intent and entities. The intent and entites are then used to perform an action, as defined by the Diatheke model. One such action is for Diatheke to send a reply to the user. The reply text is sent to the TTS engine, which then synthesizes audio to send back to the client, as shown below.\nmermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true}); graph LR; subgraph Diatheke A[ASR] --|Transcription| B[NLU] B --|Intents and Entities| C[DialogModel] C --|Reply| D[TTS] end E[ClientApplication] ==|Audio Input| A D ==|Synthesized Audio| E  Text Based Dialogs Diatheke is also capable of processing dialogs without using audio input or output. In this case, text is sent to Diatheke, which forwards it directly to the NLU engine and converts the text to an intent and entities, as it did with the transcription in the audio workflow. The intent and entities are used to perform an action, such as sending a reply to the client application in the form of text, as shown below.\nmermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true}); graph LR; subgraph Diatheke A[NLU] --|Intents and Entities| B[DialogModel] end C[ClientApplication] ==|Text Input| A B ==|Reply Text| C  Commands Diatheke uses an event stream to notify the client application when significant events happen in Diatheke. The most important of these events is the Command event, which represents a request from the server for the client application to execute a command defined in the Diatheke model. The client in turn notifies Diatheke when the command has finished, as shown below.\nmermaid.initialize({startOnLoad:true}); graph LR; subgraph Audio based A[ClientApplication] --|Audio Input| B[Diatheke] B --|Command| A A --|Command Result| B B --|Synthesized Audio| A end subgraph Text based C[ClientApplication] --|Text input| D[Diatheke] D --|Command| C C --|Command Result| D D --|Reply Text| C end  "
